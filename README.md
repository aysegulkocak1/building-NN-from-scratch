# building-NN-from-scratch
Building a binary classifier using a custom-built MLP (Multi-Layer Perceptron) from scratch, visualizing decision boundaries and training progress.

This graph shows how the loss function decreases over training epochs.

This graph shows the decision boundary plot visualizing the model's classification boundary in the feature space. The shaded regions represent the model's prediction for new data points, while the colored dots represent the actual data points with their true labels. The 'x' markers indicate data points classified by the model.
